# 📝 To-Do List App

A simple and interactive **To-Do List Web App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Tasks can be added with deadlines and urgency levels, moved across statuses (`Belum Dikerjakan`, `Sedang Dikerjakan`, `Sudah Dikerjakan`), edited, or deleted.  
The app also saves tasks to **localStorage** so data remains available after refreshing the page.
